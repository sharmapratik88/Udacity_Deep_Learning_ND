    "In this project, we'll generate our own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.

    "**Answer:** I started with exploring different settings for sequence length and batch size then realized that this didn't impact much on either the performance or convergence. Most of options I tried had a training loss of 5.X for batch 1 in epoch 1. I decided to look for research papers already published on the same, came across [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1908/1908.04332.pdf), from which I tried LSTM single layer option with a `batch size, hidden_dim = 256, 1024`. With `sequence_length = 10` the loss for first `n=1000` batches was **4.85**. With `sequence_length = 20` then `sequence_length = 25`, convergence improved, next step was to modify embedding dimension from 200 to 256 and see if the convergence of loss improves, it did. Then added weight initialization method and the final selected model gave 2.74 training loss."
